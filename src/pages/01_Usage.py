## Input Excel data format
The Excel file shuld have the following structure:
- The first row should contain the column headers.
    - The text is used as the series name in the legend.
    - TeX formatting is supported, e.g., `\\Delta` for delta.
- The columns with "Time", "Sim" or "Exp" in the second row are processed.
    - "Time" for time series, in min. Currently only one time series is supported.
    - "Sim" for simulation data. WERs are calculated from this data. Plotted as a line with shaded error range.
    - "Exp" for experimental data. Plotted without line.
    - The colours are assigned based on the order of the columns (left to right). 
    Make sure the columns are sorted in same order for both "Sim" and "Exp". 
- The third row is reserved for output data, which will be used in WFI calculator.
- The fourth row and below are for the actual data values in %.
